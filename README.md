Icarus
======

### What is Icarus?

A Joomla! labs project which is an experimental playground to explore the many possible futures of Joomla.

```
// What is Icarus
Icarus == a repo for code experiments, research, or collaboration
```

Be prepared to share

* your code
* your documentation
* prove your efforts
* accept your failures
* celebrate your successes

### What Icarus is not

```
// What Icarus is not
Icarus != endless abstract theory discussions of application development
```

Please use some other form of communication like Twitter, Facebook, Skype or perhaps you might want to create a blog. 

### Is Icarus the future of Joomla?

In a word, no. The PLT has no idea what this labs project will produce. That said, to throw away a great code is foolish too. 

### If Icarus isn't the future of Joomla, why bother?

If you are asking this question, you really shouldn't be here. Thanks for your interest.

### How do I get started?
