# Contributing to Icarus

Remember the 3 `CCC`'s for Contributing to Icarus

## Code

First, you should check and see if there is a `lab/` already working on something you are interested in or have solutions to contribute. Just make sure you choose that project branch under `lab/` to PR against. 

If you need a new branch, open a new issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/joomla-projects/icarus/issues) with the prefix [Branch] and one will be created for you.

## Communication

## Conduct

Remember to follow the [Joomla! Code of Conduct](http://www.joomla.org/about-joomla/the-project/code-of-conduct.html) or YOU will be asked to leave.
